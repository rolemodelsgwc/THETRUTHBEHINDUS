      <h2>Achievements</h2>
     <p>She has easily won the senate seat, she has sponsored at least 36 bills, and Warren single-handedly conceived of and established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.abeth Warren has a lot of accomplishments, from educating young future lawyers to writing a number of thoughtful books about the causes and effects of bankruptcy, but her most notable accomplishment before making it to the Senate would be the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). This agency was very difficult to create owing to major opposition by big banks, which the agency would help regulate on behalf of the general public. </p>
