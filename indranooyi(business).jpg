      <h2>Occupation</h2>
      <p> Indra Nooyi is an Indian American business executive and the current Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo, the second largest food and beverage business in the world by net revenue. Nooyi joined PepsiCo in 1994 and was named CFO in 2001 and then President and CEO in 2006. Nooyi has directed the company's global strategy for more than a decade and led PepsiCo's restructuring, including the 1997 divestiture of its into Tricon, now known as Yum! Brands. Nooyi also took the lead in the acquisition of Tropicana in 1998, and the merger with Quaker Oats Company, which also brought Gatorade to Pepsi Co. In 2006 she became the fifth CEO in Pepsi Co's 44-year history. She was named as the 3rd Most Powerful Woman in Business by Fortune in 2014. Since she started as CFO in 2001, the company's annual net profit has risen from $2.7 billion to $6.5 billion. Nooyi's strategic redirection of her company has been largely successful. She reclassified Pepsico’s products into three categories: “fun for you” (such as potato chips and regular soda), “better for you” (diet or low-fat versions of snacks and sodas), and “good for you” (items such as oatmeal). Her initiative was backed up with ample funding. She moved corporate spending away from junk foods and into the healthier alternatives, with the aim of improving the healthiness of even the “fun” offerings. In 2015, Nooyi removed aspartame from Diet Pepsi, furthering the shift towards healthier foods.
