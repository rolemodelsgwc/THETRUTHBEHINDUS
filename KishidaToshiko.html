       <p> Toshiko Kishida also known as  Toshiko Nakajima, was one of the first Japanese feminists. She wrote under the name Shōen.Kishida was also the very first commoner to serve as a lady-inwaiting to an empress. She had served Empress Haruko ,who was the consort of the Emperor Meiji. Kishida had left the court two years laters and started protesting against the Meiji code. The Meiji Civil Code stated that the male head of the family absolute authority over family members. Men had the sole right to control family property, determine where each family member could live, approve or disapprove of marriages and divorce, and control inheritance. The male head of each household was authorized to control his household members and assets. If a woman who had children divorced, she normally had to leave them with her former husband and his family. One provision stated: “Cripples and disabled persons and wives cannot undertake any legal action.” </p>
