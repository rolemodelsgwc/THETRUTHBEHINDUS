      <h2>Achievements</h2> .  
     <p>Michelle had accomplished many things as the First Lady. She had fought to end hunger and child obesity, therefore creating a company named Let’s Move. In the same year, she had also passed “The School Lunch Program”, which provided free and reduced meals to children of low income families.Walgreens, Supervalu, Walmart and several regional grocers announced a commitment to build or expand 1,500 stores in communities with limited or no access to healthy food. This initiative will create thousands of local jobs, and will provide access to fresh food to an estimated 9.5 million people who currently have limited access. In California alone, the Fresh Works Fund has committed 200 million dollars to this effort to increase access to healthy food.
 Darden, the world’s largest full service restaurant company, which owns Olive Garden, Red Lobster and other chains, made a commitment to improve kids’ menus by offering a fruit or vegetable and low-fat milk with every meal. Darden will also reduce total calories and sodium by 20% across their menus over the next 10 years.
